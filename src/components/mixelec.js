        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WAM-1 was a class of 25 kV AC electric locomotives that was developed in the late 1950s by the Groupement 50Hz ( a consortium of European locomotive manufacturers) for Indian Railways. The model name stands for broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Mixed traffic (M) locomotive, 1st generation. They entered service in 1960 thus making them India's first AC electric locomotive. A total of 100 WAM-1 were built by the European consortium between 1959 and 1961, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric locomotive until the WAG-1.

        <h3>WAM 2/3:</h3>
        <img src="../img/wam 2.jpg" class="image" alt=""/>
        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WAM- 2/3 was a class of 25 kV AC electric locomotives that was imported from Japan in the 1960s for Indian Railways. The model name stands for broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Mixed traffic (M) locomotive, 2nd generation. A total of 38 WAM-2/3 locomotives were built by The Japanese Group (a consortium of Mitsubishi, Hitachi and Toshiba) between 1960 and 1964. They entered service in 1960.
        </p>
        <p>
            The WAM-2/3 served both passenger and freight trains for over 40 years. As of January 2020, all locomotives have been withdrawn from service and were scrapped.
        </p>
        <p>
            These locomotives were built by a consortium of Mitsubishi, Hitachi and Toshiba (The Japanese Group, as attested by a plaque fixed on their sides) as a second option to the Europeans WAM-1. They were delivered in 1960 and were a bit lower powered than the WAM1 but had similar Bo-Bo wheel arrangement (4 wheels per bogie) with four Mitsubishi DC traction motors connected to the wheels permanently in parallel through a WN geared drive.

        <h3>WAM-4:</h3>
        <img src="../img/WAM_4.jpg" class="image" alt=""/>
        
        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WAM-4 is a class of 25 kV AC electric locomotives that was developed in 1970 by Chittaranjan Locomotive Works for Indian Railways. The model name stands for broad gauge (W), alternating current (A), mixed traffic (M) locomotive, 4th generation (4). They entered service in March 1971. A total of 500 WAM-4 were built at CLW between 1970 and 1983, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric locomotive till its successor the WAG-5.The WAM-4 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways having served both passenger and freight trains for over 52 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 1970s, the Indian Railways started a series of study projects for a high horsepower locomotive. Although the WAG-1/WAG-4 was being introduced, officials believed that a much larger and more capable locomotive was needed, especially to haul Freight trains that was heavy for any existing locomotives. These studies led to initial requirements for a locomotive with a tractive effort of 33,840 kgf (331.9 kN; 74,600 lbf) and a speed of 120 km/h (75 mph).
