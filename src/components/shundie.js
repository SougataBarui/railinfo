        <img src="../img/wds5.jpg" class="image" alt=""/>
        <p>
            The class WDS-5 is a diesel-electric locomotive used by Indian Railways for shunting and doing departmental works. The model name stands for broad gauge (W), Diesel (D), Shunting (S) engine. The WDS-6 is used all over India. The class was imported in 1967 to address the need for powerful shunting locomotive that will be able to haul 20-24 coach rakes. The previous WDS-4 class was underpowered for this kind of operation. They were manufactured by BLW Varanasi using the kits provided by ALCO. The WDS-5 can easily be recognized by their shot nose and flat-ended cab at one end. Some were sold and transferred to industrial concerns and public sectors, but have IR road numbers on them.

        <h3>WDS-6:</h3>
        <img src="../img/wds6.jpg" class="image" alt=""/>
        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WDS-6 is a diesel-electric locomotive used by the Indian Railways mainly for shunting and also for performing departmental duties. The model name stands for broad gauge (W), Diesel (D), Shunting (S) engine, 6th generation (6). As of April 2022, 375 units of this class are currently in use all over India. This class was designed in 1975 to address the need for a powerful shunting locomotive with the ability to haul 20- to 24-coach rakes. The previous WDS-4 class was found to be grossly underpowered for this kind of operation. A WDS-6 locomotive basically consists of a YDM-4 powerpack (a 6-cylinder, 4-stroke, inline, turbo-supercharged ALCo engine) mounted on a WDM-2 body frame.
