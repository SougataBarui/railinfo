        <img src="../img/BOXN.jpg" class="image" alt=""/>
        <p>
            The predominant high-sided bogie open wagon on IR. It replaced the original BOX during the early 2000s. Featuring AAR 'E' high-tensile coupler with high-capacity draft gear, CASNUB 22 NLB cast steel bogies with cartridge tapered roller bearings. Air brakes and parking brakes. Rated speed 80km/h (some older ones were rated at 75km/h), these are used for bulk movement of material commodities (coal, iron ore, stone etc.).

        <p>
            The BCNA wagon, also known as 'BCN/A', is a variant of the BCN design was developed to be less long but increased height to keep the capacity the same. It has welded construction compared to the original BCN which was riveted. BCNA wagons are covered bogie wagons (capable of being made water-tight for delicate commodities) with cartridge tapered roller bearings, cast steel bogie, air brakes. Two doors on each side. Uses BCN design's 2-tonne overload capacity. These are by far the most common covered wagon on IR.
