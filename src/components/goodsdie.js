        <img src="../img/wdg4.jpg" class="image" alt=""/>
        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WDG-4G (GE ES43ACmi) is a class of dual-cabin freight-hauling diesel-electric locomotive used by the Indian Railways (IR). The locomotive is designed by GE Transportation and is based on its Evolution Series, which are used in North America. The class is meant for freight hauling and replaces the older American Locomotive Company (ALCO)-designed locomotives, which have been the mainstay diesels of Indian Railways since 1962. Equipped with a 12-cylinder fully turbocharged GEVO engine, it is claimed to be 50% more environmentally friendly than its predecessors and is the first in the country to be compliant with level one of the emission norms set by the International Union of Railways (UIC-1). The locomotive has two cabs for easy reversal, both of which are air conditioned.

        <h3>WDG-5:</h3>
        <img src="../img/wdg5.jpg" class="image" alt=""/>
        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WDG-5 (EMD GT50AC) is a class of heavy haul Diesel-electric locomotive built by Banaras Locomotive Works, Varanasi in collaboration with Electro-Motive Diesel. At a rated power output of 5,500 horsepower (4,100 kW), it is the second most powerful diesel locomotive class on Indian Railways, just out-powered by the 6,000 horsepower (4,500 kW) WDG-6G. Derived from the EMD SD80MAC, it was meant as a direct upgrade to the WDG 4 aka GT46MAC (an SD70MAC derivative). The locomotive series is named Bheem, after the strong Pandav brother from epic Mahabharata. The loco has the EMD 20N-710G3B-EC (20 cylinder engine) of the EMD SD80MAC and an AC-AC transmission. Since the loco has been developed by installing a v20-710 prime mover and replacing the standard v16 in the WDG4 GT46MAC locomotive, the model was re-designated by adding 4 to the predecessor model, with GT-46 becoming GT-50, owing to the number of cylinders going from 16 to 20, thereby making it the First EMD locomotive in the GT-series to use a v20-710 engine.

        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WDG-6G (GE ES57ACi)[1] is a class of diesel-electric locomotive used by the Indian Railways for freight duty. The locomotive is a higher power variant of the WDG-4G locomotive which was also designed by General Electric. The design platform is based on the GE Evolution Series and features a 4-stroke 16-cylinder fully turbocharged engine which delivers around 6,000 horsepower (4,500 kW), making it the most powerful diesel locomotive of IR (second-most being the WDG-5 aka EMD GT50AC).It is the only 6,000 HP Diesel electric locomotive at 23t/axle weight, making it the lightest locomotive in its category in the world.
