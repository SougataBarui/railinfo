        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WAG-1 was a class of 25 kV AC electric locomotives that was imported from Europe in the 1960s for Indian Railways. The model name stands for broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Goods traffic (G) locomotive, 1st generation (1). A total of 112 WAG-1 were built by The European Group 50 Hz Group/European Group/50 Cycles Group (consortium) between 1963 and 1966. They entered service in 1964. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Forty-two locomotives of this type were ordered from European Group. Five of these were completely assembled in Europe and the remaining were built at CLW. A repeat order was placed on for 20 locomotives in 1963. Further these locomotives were manufactured at CLW.

The model name stands for broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Goods traffic (G) locomotive, 2nd generation (2). A total of 45 WAG-2 were built by The Japanese Group (a consortium of Mitsubishi, Hitachi and Toshiba) between 1964 and 1965. They entered service in 1964.
        </p>
        <p>
            The WAG-2 served both passenger and freight trains for over 37 years. As of January 2001, all locomotives have been withdrawn from service. All were scrapped.
        </p>
        <p>
            These locomotives were built by a consortium of Mitsubishi, Hitachi and Toshiba (The Japanese Group, as attested by a plaque fixed on their sides) as a second option to the Europeans WAG-1. They were delivered in 1964 and were higher powered than the WAM-1 but had similar Bo-Bo wheel arrangement (4 wheels per bogie) with four Hitachi DC traction motors connected to the wheels permanently in parallel through a WN geared drive.

The model name stands for broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Goods traffic (G) engine, 3rd (3). A total of 10 WAG-3 locomotives were built by The European Group 50 Hz Group/European Group/50 Cycles Group (consortium) in 1965. They entered service in 1965. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The WAG-3 served mainly freight trains for over 35 years. As of January 2020, All locomotives have been removed from service all were scrapped.Ten locomotives of this type were ordered from European Group. All these locomotives have been assembled in Europe. First locomotive was put in service in July, 1965. The typical feature of these locomotives is a Monomotor bogie. This construction results in substantial saving in weight in traction equipment and gives better adhesion. These locomotives utilize silicon rectifiers for conversion of ac power into dc. The traction motors are force ventilated and are fully suspended type.

        <p>
            The first fifty-six locomotive's equipment were procured from European Group. They had Auxiliary machines and some control equipments have been procured from indigenous sources. All these locomotives were built by CLW. The typical feature of these locomotives is Monomotor Bogie. This construction results in substantial saving in weight in traction equipment and gives better adhesion. These locomotives utilise silicon rectifiers for conversion of ac power into dc. The traction motors are force ventilated and are fully suspended type. These motors are permanently grouped in parallel and speed control is obtained through HT tap changer and TM field weakening.

The model name stands for broad gauge (W), alternating current (A), goods traffic (G) engine, 5th generation (5). They entered service in 1980. A total of 1196 WAG-5 were built at CLW and BHEL between 1978 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric locomotive till its successor the WAG-7.
        </p>
        <p>
            The WAG-5 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways currently serving both freight and passenger trains for over 43 years. This class provided the basic design for a number of other locomotives, like WAG-7 and the WCM-6. However, with the advent of new 3-phase locomotives like WAG-9 and WAG-12, the WAG-5 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains and now the aging fleet the WAG-5 locomotives are rapidly being withdrawn from mainline duties and scrapped.

The model name stands for broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Goods traffic (G), 9th generation (9) locomotive. They entered service in 1996. A total of 4550 WAG-9 have been built at Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW), with more units being built at Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW), Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) and Patiala Locomotive Works (PLW). It was the most powerful freight locomotive of its fleet until the formal introduction of the WAG-12.
        </p>
        <p>
            The WAG-9 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving freight trains for over 27 years. A passenger variant of the WAG-9 was developed namely the WAP-7 locomotive by modifying the gear ratio to pull lighter loads at higher speeds. Nowadays, It is a common locomotive used in freight trains.

        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WAG-12B is a class of 25 kV AC electric locomotives that was developed in 2017 by Alstom with technological collaboration with Indian Railways. The model name stands for wide gauge(W), Alternating Current (A), Goods traffic (G) locomotive-12 . They entered trial service in 2019. A total of 360 WAG-12B have been built at Electric Locomotive Factory, Madhepura, Bihar, India.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a power output of 12,000 hp, the WAG 12 is twice as powerful as its immediate predecessor, WAG-9, making it one of the most powerful freight locomotives in the world. The locomotive is being developed for deployment on the Dedicated Freight Corridors, where it will be used to haul freight trains weighing more than 6,000 tonnes (5,900 long tons; 6,600 short tons) at speeds of 100 km/h (62 mph) to 120 km/h (75 mph), essentially doubling the average speed of freight trains in the sector.
