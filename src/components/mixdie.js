        <p>
            The WDM-1 was the first class of Wide Gauge (W), Diesel powered (D), Mixed load (M), meant for hauling both freight and passenger trains. These are also the first mainline diesel engines imported after Independence. They were even the fastest diesel locomotives till the advent of WDM 2 and WDM 4. They used to haul ore/freight trains on SER. In the end, they were relegated to shunting/piloting duties or hauling sugarcane freight trains. One unit, #17000, is preserved at National Rail Museum, Delhi.

        <h3>WDM-2:</h3>
        <img src="../img/wdm 2.jpg" class="image" alt=""/>
        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WDM-2 is a class of diesel-electric locomotive that was developed in 1962 by American Locomotive Company (ALCO) for Indian Railways. The model name stands for broad gauge (W), Diesel (D), Mixed traffic (M) engine, 2nd generation (2). They entered service in 1962. A total of more than 2,700 WDM-2 was built at ALCO and Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW or DLW, as it was formerly Diesel Locomotive Works), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive until its successor the WDM-3A.
        </p>
        <p>
            The WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 60 years. A few WDM-2 units were exported to neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like WDG-4 and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both in mainline and departmental duties. As of April 2023, 3 locomotives still retain "operational status" on the mainline as WDM-2, with further examples in service as WDM-3A or WDM-2S.

        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WDM-3 is a type of diesel-hydraulic locomotive that was developed by Henschel for Indian Railways in 1962. The model name "WDM-3" stands for broad gauge (W), Diesel (D), Mixed traffic (M) engine, 3rd generation (3). These locomotives were put into service between 1970 and 1971, and a total of eight were built between 1962 and 1970. However, they were decommissioned at Gooty in 1995 and are now retired from service.
