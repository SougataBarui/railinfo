        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WAP-1 is a class of 25 kV AC electric locomotives that was developed in 1980 by Chittaranjan Locomotive Works for Indian Railways. The model name stands for broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Passenger traffic (P) locomotive, 1st generation (1). They entered service in late 1981. A total of 65 WAP-1 were built at CLW between 1980 and 1996, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric passenger locomotive until its successor, the WAP-4.

            The Indian locomotive class WAP-3 was a class of 25 kV AC electric locomotives that was designed by Research Design and Standards Organization (RDSO) and Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) for Indian Railways in 1987. The model name stands for Broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Passenger traffic (P) locomotive, 3rd generation. They entered service in 1988. They were the faster variant of the previous WAP-1 class. A total of 9 WAP-3 were converted from existing WAP-1 units at CLW between 1987 and 1988. All locomotives were now withdrawn from service and converted back to WAP-1.

        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WAP-4 is a class of 25 kV AC electric locomotives that was developed in 1993 by Chittaranjan Locomotive Works for Indian Railways. The model name stands for broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Passenger traffic (P) locomotive, 4th generation (4). They entered service in late 1994. A total of 778 WAP-4 were built at CLW between 1993 and 2015, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric passenger locomotive until the WAP-7.
        </p>
        <p>
            The WAP-4 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 29 years. This class provided the basic design for other locomotives like the WAP-6 . Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like WAP-7, a significant number are still in use, both in mainline duties. Production of this class was halted in December 2015 with locomotive number 25051 being the last unit to be rolled out.

        <p>
            The Indian locomotive class WAP-5 is the name of a class of "High Speed" electric locomotives produced and used by Indian Railways. The first 10 locomotives were imported from ABB in Switzerland in 1995. These locomotives are a hybrid design mixing SBB-CFF-FFS Re 460 design and German DB Class 120 mechanics and chassis.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the notable features of WAP-5 is regenerative braking. Other notable features of this loco are the provision of taps from the main loco transformer for hotel load, pantry loads, flexible gear coupling, wheel-mounted disc brakes, and a potential for speed enhancement to 200 km/h (120 mph). Braking systems include 160 kN (36,000 lbf) regenerative brakes, loco disc brakes, automatic train air brakes, and a charged spring parking brake.

The model name stands for broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Passenger traffic (P) locomotive, 6th generation (6). They entered service in April 1996. A total of 17 WAP-6 units were built at CLW between 1995 and 1998.
        </p>
        <p>
            The WAP-6 were intended to be the faster variant of the successful WAP-4, but failed trials and were restricted to a top speed of 105 km/h. Now all units have been converted to WAP-4 specifications. All were homed at Asansol (ASN) shed but after conversion reallocated to Howrah (HWH) shed.

            The Indian locomotive class WAP-7 is a class of 25 kV AC electric locomotives that was developed in 1999 by Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) for Indian Railways. The model name stands for broad gauge (W), AC Current (A), Passenger traffic (P) locomotive, 7th generation (7). They entered service in 2000. A total of 1503 WAP-7 have been built, with more units being built at CLW, Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) and Patiala Locomotive Works (PLW).
        </p>
        <p>
            The WAP-7 is the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving passenger trains for over 23 years. It is a passenger variant of the WAG-9 freight locomotive with a modified gear ratio to pull lighter loads at higher speeds. With an output of 6125HP, it is the most powerful passenger locomotive in the Indian Railways fleet, and the most numerous passenger locomotive in India. The WAP-7 is capable of hauling 24 coach trains at speeds 110–140 km/h (68–87 mph).
